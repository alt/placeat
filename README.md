This is the README file of the placeat package. The package provides several commands to place content at an arbitrary position of the current page in any document. For orientation, a grid is drawn. Simple graphical elements like arrows and circles can easily be drawn and positioned.

To produce the package files, run lualatex on placeat.dtx, wich should result in the creation of the following files:
  placeat.pdf  (documentation)
  placeat.sty  (LaTeX user interface)
  placeat.lua  (Lua package code)

You need an up-to-date TeX Live (2017 at best) and compilation with LuaLaTeX to use this package. A full, updated MiKTeX should also work. (Not tested.)

Hope you have fun with this package!
